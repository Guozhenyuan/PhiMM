In 1992, while serving as a policeman in Utravnic, he refused to join the Muslim forces and, as a consequence, he was accused of having stolen 40 rifles from the police station.

Further, in June 1993 Kraljeva Sutjeska was occupied by Muslim troops. Along with other residents, the applicant participated in the defence of the village. Later, he was forced to leave the village and, on 15 March 1994, he arrived in Croatia with his parents and siblings.

Finding that the applicant held both Bosnian and Croatian citizenship, the Board referred to a decision concerning asylum seekers with such double nationality taken by the Swedish Government on 26 May 1994. According to the decision, the prevailing situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina rendered deportations to that country impossible. Consequently, in assessing applications from these asylum seekers, the crucial question was whether they could be afforded protection in Croatia. The Board noted that, according to available information, persons in the applicant’s situation did not risk to be sent from Croatia to Bosnia-Hercegovina against their will. Moreover, no acts of warfare had taken place on Croatian territory for some time and a cease-fire had been agreed upon by the contending parties.

Consequently, the Immigration Board shared the opinions expressed in its decision of 30 September 1994 and the decision taken by the Aliens Appeals Board on 29 March 1995. Furthermore, the Immigration Board found that there were no reasons of a humanitarian nature to grant the applicant a residence permit.\", \"Following the applicant\\u2019s appeal, the Appeals Board, on 2 June 1997, quashed the Immigration Board\\u2019s decision and referred the case back for re-examination. The Appeals Board found that no oral hearing had been held by the Immigration Board, as required by law.\", \"The Immigration Board held an oral hearing in the case on 11 June 1997 during which the applicant stated that, despite the fact that he held a Croatian passport, he did not possess the full rights of a Croatian citizen. Moreover, his parents and one of his brothers lived in Croatia where they had difficulties to support themselves. In Croatia nothing in particular would happen to the applicant but it would be hard for him to find work and a place to live.\", \"In a decision of 30 June 1997 the Immigration Board rejected the applicant\\u2019s new application on the same grounds as those expressed in the quashed decision. On 17 April 1998 the Appeals Board rejected the applicant\\u2019s appeal. The Appeals Board noted that the applicant is an ethnic Croat and, as such, would be at risk in his Bosnian home district, dominated by Muslims. However, the applicant\\u2019s statements did not indicate that he would face ill-treatment in Croatia.\", \"In medical certificates issued by the psychiatric clinic at the hospital in Karlskrona on 30 November 1998 and 19 January 1999 chief physician G.S. and therapist I.S. stated that the applicant had undergone treatment for some time at the clinic for a post-traumatic stress syndrome. Allegedly, the enforcement of the deportation order would seriously impair his mental state and could lead to a suicide attempt. The clinic submitted the first certificate to the Aliens Appeals Board and requested that the enforcement be suspended.\", \"By a decision of 9 December 1998 the Appeals Board suspended the enforcement of the deportation order for an unspecified period of time.\"\n",

Moreover , no acts of warfare had taken place on NORP territory for some time and a cease - fire had been agreed upon by the contending parties .
